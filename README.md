A little repository where to store some code created to get digital signals from a joystick and a push button.

I'm usign an arcade joystick and push button like [this one](https://www.amazon.it/EG-STARTS-maniglia-millimetri-Raspberry/dp/B076JBMBHZ/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1536252120&sr=1-3&keywords=arcade%2Bverde&th=1) and an [Arduino micro]().

This is still a WIP.
